## A 404 status code, commonly known as "Not Found," indicates that the web server could not locate the requested resource. This means the server received the client's request but was unable to find the specific page or file the user was trying to access. It's a client-side error, meaning the problem lies with the user's request rather than the server's ability to handle it. 
Common Causes:
Incorrect URL: Typos or misspellings in the URL are a frequent cause. 
Moved or Deleted Page: The requested page may have been removed or relocated without proper redirection. 
Broken Links: Links on other websites or within your own site might be pointing to non-existent pages. 
Server Configuration: Issues with the server's configuration can also lead to 404 errors. 
What to Do:
Check the URL: Carefully verify the URL for any errors. 
Refresh the page: Sometimes a temporary glitch can cause a 404, refreshing the page might help. 
Search the site: Use the website's search functionality to locate the desired page. 
Check for broken links: If you're a website owner, audit your site for broken links. 
Use a 301 redirect: If a page has been moved, implement a 301 redirect to send users to the new location. 
Contact the website owner: If you can't resolve the issue, reach out to the website's support team.
