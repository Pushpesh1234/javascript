## The type="module" attribute in an HTML  "<script>" tag informs the browser that the ##    JavaScript file being  included is an ES ## Module. This designation triggers specific ## behaviors and features not available to  ##  traditional "classic" scripts.



## Key characteristics and implications of type="module":
## Module System Support:
## It enables the use of import and export statements within the script, allowing for modular code ## organization, where code can be broken down into separate, reusable files.
## Strict Mode by Default:
## Scripts declared with type="module" are automatically executed in strict mode, which helps catch common ## coding errors and enforces stricter parsing and error handling.
## Deferred Execution:
## Module scripts are automatically deferred, meaning their execution is delayed until the HTML document has  been fully parsed. This is similar to the defer attribute on classic scripts, but it's inherent to ## modules.
## CORS Requirements for Cross-Origin Fetching:
## Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) ## protocol for fetching resources from different origins, enhancing security.
## Scoped Variables:
## Variables and functions declared at the top level of a module are scoped to that module and do not ## pollute the global scope, preventing naming conflicts.
## Single Evaluation:
## A module and its dependencies are evaluated only once, even if imported multiple times, ensuring ## efficient resource management.

## CORS Explained above details

### Module scripts, unlike classic scripts, enforce the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protocol for fetching resources from different origins. This requirement enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to resources.
### Key Differences and Implications:
## Classic Scripts:
### When a classic <script> tag with a src attribute points to a different origin, the browser will generally fetch and execute the script without requiring explicit CORS headers from the server, for backward compatibility reasons. This means that if the server hosting the classic script does not explicitly deny access, the script will typically load.
Module Scripts:
When a <script type="module"> tag with a src attribute points to a different origin, the browser initiates a CORS preflight request (an OPTIONS request) to the server hosting the module. The server must respond with appropriate CORS headers, such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin, to explicitly grant permission for the module to be loaded by the requesting origin. If these headers are not present or do not allow the requesting origin, the browser will block the script from loading, resulting in a CORS error.
Why the Difference?
This distinction in behavior is primarily due to the security implications of module scripts. Module scripts are designed to be part of a larger, more structured application architecture, and their ability to import and interact with other modules necessitates stricter security controls to prevent malicious cross-origin attacks. CORS provides a robust mechanism for servers to explicitly control which origins are allowed to access their resources, thereby mitigating potential security vulnerabilities associated with cross-origin module loading.
