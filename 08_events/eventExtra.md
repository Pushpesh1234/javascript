/*About timeStamp property
    The timeStamp property is part of the
    Event object in JavaScript. It  represents the time at which an event was
        created, measured in milliseconds since a reference point (usually the start of the document's lifecycle or the
        Unix epoch, depending on the browser). It’s automatically included in every event object passed to an event
        listener, such as those for click, keydown, or mouseover events.
          
      What Does timeStamp Do?
    The timeStamp property doesn’t “do” anything on its own—it’s a read-only value you can use in your code for
        various purposes. Here’s what you can do with it:
        
        1. Measure Time Between Events:
        Calculate the time difference between two events, like clicks or key presses.
         */
    let lastClickTime = 0;
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    const timeDifference = e.timeStamp - lastClickTime;
    console.log(`Time since last click: ${timeDifference} ms`);
    lastClickTime = e.timeStamp;
});
// Debouncing or Throttling:
// Prevent rapid-fire events (e.g., limiting button clicks within a time window).
let lastEventTime = 0;
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (e.timeStamp - lastEventTime < 1000) { // Only allow clicks 1 second apart
        return;
    }
    console.log("Button clicked!");
    lastEventTime = e.timeStamp;
});


// Debugging:
// Log when events occur to analyze user interactions or performance.

document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    console.log(`Click at ${e.timeStamp} ms`);
});

/*Animation Timing:
Coordinate animations or transitions based on event timing.*/
/*Browser-Specific Behavior
Reference Point: The exact "zero" point for timeStamp varies:
Most modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) use the time since the document’s navigation start (performance.timeOrigin).
You can get the absolute time by combining it with performance.timeOrigin:
javascript*/
console.log(performance.timeOrigin + e.timeStamp); // Time since Unix epoch
